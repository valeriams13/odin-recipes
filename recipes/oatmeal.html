        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This dish is one of my all-time favorite breakfast recipes. The reason is because it is really easy to make, 
            and not to mention it fills me up before a long day at work or school. I make it in a microwave to make it 
            extra easy. Also, it is a nutritious breakfast filled with
            healthy carbohydrates, protein, fats, and vitamins from the fruit. It's so yummy!

        <p>I hope you try it out, enjoy!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cups of oatmeal</li>
            <li>Water or milk (to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of peanut butter</li>
            <li>Fruit (to taste, can be frozen or fresh. My favorite are berries or bananas!)</li>
            <li>Sweetener to taste (I like stevia)</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you will put your oats and the water/milk into a microwave-safe bowl, along with the sweetener, salt, cinnamon, and 
                peanut butter. Make sure to mix it all in.</li>
            <li>Now, put it into the microwave for around 1 minute and a half. Take it out, stir it, and put it in for 1 more minute.
                I like doing this because I feel it makes it creamier and thicker.</li>
            <li>When you take it out, you can go ahead and add the fruit, and/or more peanut butter if you would like. It is that simple!</li>
        </ol>
