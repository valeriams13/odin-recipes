# odin-recipes

This assignment puts into practice all that I learnt during my HTML foundations course. It consists of making a site for recipes that 
I chose, and making separate links in which I describe the procedure to make them, as well as an image.

This assignment was the first one I've done in HTML, and I found it pretty easy to pick up on, and I am very proud for making it in about 1-2 hours. I did not struggle and I really enjoyed making it, and I think that I am confident in my basic HTML abilities.
